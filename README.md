# Project title : Reservoir Operation using Dynamic Programming  
## Dynamic Programming : 
   it is multistage decision making based on various stages and states,stages of operation is time instants and states represents theresources level at the time of operation,
and it involves lot of mathematical computation to be done instantly which may be discrete or continuous. Hence programming language(Python) can be used.
## Scope and Objectives :
   To determine optimum Reservoir Operating conditions using Dynamic Programming and to develop an algorithm using Python.
## Methodology
   Multistage decision problem is a solution of multiple objective function problem which is divided into problems of individual objective function, and solution of one 
objective function depends on decision of preceeding objective function.
## Conclusion :
   A Python programming code is developed for reservoir operation which is tested and validated.
